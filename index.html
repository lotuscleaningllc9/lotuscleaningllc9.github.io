        <h3>Curb Appeal </h3>
        <p>Clean business windows are imperative to displaying a cleanliness within the standards of business. Businesses often request window cleaning services from professional window cleaners because their employees are not insured to be on ladders, employees do not have proper ladder training, or because after the windows have been washed the windows still do not have a clean look due to streaking or hard to reach areas. With the amazing sunny weather we get in the Tri-Cities the streaks can become very obvious as the sun shines through the windows. The technicians working at Clear View Window Cleaning and Pressure Washing have not only the basic ladder training required through OSHA and Labor &amp; Industries but also have extensive monthly continued training and daily ladder safety equipment checks. We work on ladders everyday!</p>
        <h3>Window Maintenance </h3>
        <p>Windows require routine maintenance and cleaning to prolong the life of windows. Clean windows will allow for the full availability of view that the windows were intended to display. Cleaning the windows to free them of dirt and hard water deposits will allow more natural light into your house. If you are seeking a window cleaning to achieve increased curb appeal or display a level of cleanliness your customers and neighboring businesses will undoubtedly notice the difference! </p>
        <h3>Pressure Washing </h3>
        <p>Pressure washing is a popular option as a service offered to businesses due to the large amount of dust and sand deposits from wind. Spider webs can also pose aesthetic problems. Utilizing professional lift and reach equipment allows a cleaning ability from the top to the bottom of the building as well as surface cleaning for sidewalks and parking lots. Visit our pressure washing page for more details.  </p>
        <h3>Discount Programs </h3>
        <p>Benefits of regular commercial maintenance customers include discounts with window washing maintenance and pressure washing maintenance. We can provide a <br>

        <p>Most people have a general concept of how to clean a window. However when dealing with glass it is important to identify what type of glass being cleaned and if there are any manufactured coverings or after-market tint on the window. Different types of glass as well as different types of coverings and tints require different methods of cleaning. Different methods of cleaning allow for either a detergent, a chemical, acid or wax. Some of the methods and products for cleaning certain windows main not work well for other windows. It is possible to discolor glass, create haze or scratch the glass if the incorrect method or product is itilized. To reach the tops of most windows ladder work of some type is required. Different types of windows require different types of ladders. To reach the glass of high windows can not only be a daunting task, but also very dangerous. Always call a professional with proper ladders in good condition, ladder training, ladder safety equipment and chemical certifications.  </p>

        <h3>Screen Cleaning  </h3>
        <p>Screens need cleaning and maintenance the same as windows do, however may not need to be cleaned as often. Homeowners are often working on a budget and request to not have the screens cleaned as often. For those reasons screen cleaning is an additional service offered in addition to the General Exterior Window Washing Service. The process for screen cleaning is removal of the screen, rinsing the screen, using a soft brush and detergents to agitate the dirt on the screen mesh and frame, final rinse, dry the screen, apply a protectant to the screen fabric and then replacing the screen back into the window frame after the glass has been cleaned. The screen protectant extends the life of the screen, preventing deterioration of the screen fabric. There is no need for the customer to remove the screens. The technicians have screen removal tools and can safely remove the screen from outside without damaging the frame. The screen cleaning can be requested at the time of the estimate or during the service but if the screens appear dirty the technicians will offer screen cleaning as we do prefer to clean everything that needs cleaning, but only charge what is needed. An estimate for screen cleaning can be provided in person, over the phone or by email. </p>
        <h3>Pressure Washing</h3>
        <p>Pressure washing is a popular option as a service offered to houses due to the large amount of dust and sand deposits from wind. Spider webs can also pose aesthetic problems. Utilizing professional lift and reach equipment allows a cleaning ability from the top to the bottom of the building as well as surface cleaning for walkways and driveways. Visit our pressure washing page for more details. </p>
        <h3>Track Cleaning</h3>
        <p>The frames of windows, as well as the exterior tracks where the screens affix to the window frame, are cleaned as part of our General Window Washing Service. However the interior tracks that allow the window to slide open and closed often take a great amount of time to clean properly. Interior tracks do not normally get dirty as quickly as the glass and therefore are priced separately; not part of the Interior General Window Washing Service. Track cleaning can however be added to the Interior General Window Washing Service at the time from the time the estimate is provided or during the actual service. Often if the interior tracks need cleaning, but has not yet been requested, the technicians will offer track cleaning as we do prefer to clean everything that needs cleaning, but only charge what is needed. An estimate for track cleaning can be provided in person, over the phone or by email. </p>

Hard water staining on glass is unsightly and in many cases cause permanent damage to the glass requiring replacement of the glass. A common misconception is that spraying water onto windows and screens to rinse the dirt off is safe. When the water is sprayed onto the window the minerals in that water are left on the window and allowed to build up when the water dries. When the window is washed the dirt should be agitated with a non-scratch cleaning pad to allow the dirt to be removed effectively. However preventing scratches on the glass during the agitation process is imperative. Even small scratches that may not be visible to the naked eye will eventually start a process called hazing and hazing should be avoided. Regular household filters and water softeners still allow minerals through to the surface being cleaned. Minerals in water are what make water taste good! The minerals in the water, however if filtered or softened, will still over time start to build up and stain the glass. </p>

        <h3>Types of Hard Water </h3>
        <p>Different types of minerals result in different types of hard water. The minerals and chemicals in irrigation water are going to leave different types of hard water. Some hard water remedies may work more effectively on hard water stains than other remedies due to the type of minerals or chemical stains being removed. Irrigation and house water conditions vary from area to area depending on their source and handling processes. Some hard water can be removed with over the counter remedies such as Ammonia and Vinegar, however other types of hard water or layering of hard water may require an industrial acid or wax designed specifically for glass to have great results.</p>
        <h3>Hard Water Removal Process </h3>
        <p>Most windows can be restored to like-new condition. Our technicians can, at no cost, visit your location to identify the type of glass, identify the type of hard water and then provide a free on-site test spot on the water stained glass. The test spot will demonstrate how much hard water will come off with the hard water service. A common error that we normally see is that hard water stains often are left on glass by the customer for a long period of time before a professional is called. The longer the hard water is left on the glass untreated, the more likely the hard water will permanently leach into the glass, causing a stain on the glass through a process called etching. </p>
        <p>What sets us apart from other companies is that we apply a protective wax on the glass as part of the process after the hard water stain has been removed, prolonging the value of the service. We have found that customers really appreciate having a protective barrier applied to the glass in an effort to prevent costly repairs in the future. </p>
      <p>An estimate for hard water stain removal requires an on-site estimate. It is suggested to allow the technician to provide a free test spot on the glass in an effort to demonstrate the amount of hard water that can effectively be removed. We find customers appreciate the free test spot as it proves how effectiveness of our glass restoration process before committing to the service. </p></td>

        <h1>Solar Panel Cleaning</h1>
      <p>Cleaning solar panels is not expensive. When cleaned in a proper manner with professional equipment our customers are often surprised by how quickly the cleaning process is!</p>
      <p>Solar panels are protected by a top layered coating of glass. If you have solar panels then you most likely have a good understanding of why it is important to keep the glass over top of the solar panels clean and as transparent as possible. Freeing the glass of dirt and other obstructions that prevent clarity will directly result in a more effective solar panel system. Washing the solar panels with equipment or chemicals that scratch or haze the surface of the glass can result in permanent damage resulting in a less efficient system. Solar panels are a large investment. Protect your investment while getting the most out of it! </p>
      <p>A common misconception is that spraying water onto the solar panels to rinse off the dirt is effective. The dirt should be agitated with a non-scratch cleaner to be removed effectively. Preventing scratches on the glass is imperative. Even small scratches that may not be visible to the naked eye but eventually starts a process called hazing should be avoided. When rinsing the dirt off of the solar panels it is suggested also that only pure filtered water be used to prevent mineral deposit staining. Regular household filters and water softeners still allow minerals through to the surface being cleaned. Minerals in water are what make water taste good! The minerals in the water, however less than not filtered or softened, will still over time start to build up and stain. Clear View Window Cleaning and Pressure Washing utilizes Industry Grade Non-Scratch Brushes to agitate the dirt, attached to Carbon Fiber Poles, combined with 5-Stage Water Purification Filters removing 100% of all minerals allowing for the water to dry spot free! </p></td>
